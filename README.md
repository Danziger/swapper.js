Versioning
----------

**CURRENT VERSION:** `2.0.0`

Swapper.js will be maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) guidelines, so releases will be numbered with the following format when possible:

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

1. Breaking backward compatibility bumps the `MAJOR` (and resets the minor and patch).
2. Adding functionality without breaking backward compatibility bumps the `MINOR` (and resets the patch).
3. Bug fixes and misc. changes bumps the `PATCH`.





Classes
-------

In order to make swapper.js work as it is supposed to, you need to define the following classes with the specified behavior. The `classNames` attribute can be changed to use custom class names, but it will be updated **in the prototype**, so all the instances of `Swapper` will be affected. You can change it using the `options` argument of the constructor. We will see that in detail later.

 - `.page`: Nothing to do. This class will be used just to automatically find the elements you want to use as _pages_ in the DOM. The automatic selection will be explained later.
 - `.pageButton`: Same as `.page` but for buttons.
 - `.currentPage`: This class will be used to mark the current _page_, so it must apply the proper CSS properties to make it show up. You can also use transitions to make the _pages_ appear and disappear nicely and to trigger a `transitioEnd` event, that will call a callback when the chosen property's transition finish. You can set a `0s` transition on any property if you want the callback to be called immediately. We will see that in detail later.
 - `.currentButton`: This class will be used to mark the current _page_'s button (when provided), so it must apply the proper CSS properties to differentiate it from the rest.
 - `.loadingPage`: This class is used to mark a _page_ as _loading_. You can use it to apply some CSS effects on it to show that (show a simple loader using pseudoelements or even a more elaborated one showing a bunch of HTML child elements over it).
 - `.deadPage`: This class is used to apply the same or similar effects that `.currentPage` but it will be used to fade away _pages_ that will be removed from the DOM once the chosen property's transition finish.

By default, the CSS property whose transition end indicates when to call the callbacks is `opacity`. We will see how to change that, the class names and how to disable the callbacks next.

Check the examples for a better idea on what these classes should do.





Examples

None for the moment. They will be here soon.





Attributes
----------

###PUBLIC

 - `SwapperInstance.pagesIDs`: Array of ids (Strings) of the _pages_ elements in the DOM.
 - `SwapperInstance.pagesDOM`: Array of DOM elements that represent the _pages_.
 - `SwapperInstance.buttonsIDs`: Array of ids (Strings) of the buttons elements in the DOM.
 - `SwapperInstance.buttonsDOM`: Array of DOM elements that represent the buttons.
 - `SwapperInstance.callbacks`: Object of callbacks associated to each _page_ (one or none per page). The key must be equal to the _page_'s we want to put the callback on and its value must be a function.
 - `SwapperInstance.callbacksEnabled`: Boolean telling if the callbacks are enabled or not.
 - `SwapperInstance.pagesCount`: Integer telling the number of _pages_.
 - `SwapperInstance.masterProperty`: String of the CSS property whose transition end indicates when to call the callbacks if enabled. `opacity` by default.
 - `SwapperInstance.transitionEvent \ Swapper.prototype.transitionEvent`: **In prototype**. String of transition end event supported by the current browser.
 - `SwapperInstance.classNames \ Swapper.prototype.classNames`: **In prototype**. Object containing the class names to be used. Explained in detail in the following section.





Methods
-------

###CONSTRUCTOR
`SwapperInstance = new Swapper(IDs, currentIndex, defaultIndex, options)`

Creates a new instance of the `Swapper` class to manage all the _pages_ that match the `IDs` selector/s. You can also specify the current one providing the `currentIndex` argument and the default one with the `defaultIndex` argument. The last argument indicates some extra options that are not so commonly used.

|         Type         |         Argument         | Description |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| String / Array | `IDs` | Array of Strings of the IDs of the elements (_pages_) that should be shown and hidden. It can be a single String if there is only one ID. In that last case, there is a special value `"autoMODE"` (case sensitive) that will search for all elements in the current page with the page class (`.page` by default). If you want to create the object without any _pages_ just provide an empty Array or a falsy value (`0`, `null`,  `undefined`, `false`, ...). If any of the specified ids does not exist, an error will be shown in console (but not thrown).
| Integer | `currentIndex` | Index of the current element inside IDs range. It can be null if there's no page currently selected
| Integer | `defaultIndex` | Index of the current element inside IDs range. It can be null if you don't need the default-page feature. The **default-page feature** will make you toggle between the current _page_ and the default _page_ everytime you try to select the current (already selected) _page_.
| Object | `options` | All the options avaible are explained next.

`options` argument:

|      Type      |      key      | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Boolean | `anchorMode` | `true` if you want to use the URL hash as well as classes to select the current _page_. `false` by default.
| Object | `classNames` | Object specifying the class names to be used (the ones explained in the previous section). The possible keys-values to be set have the same name both for key and value (default class name), so as said before, they are: `page`, `pageButton`, `currentPage`, `currentButton`, `loadingPage` and `deadPage`. Different key-value pairs will be discarded when merged with the default ones. Take into account that the class names **won't be validated** in any way, so an empty string or other values will be accepted and that will probably cause the module to throw an error later. 
| String / Array | `buttonsIDs` | Array of Strings of the IDs of the elements that should be used as buttons. It can be a single String if there is only one ID. In that last case, there is a special value `"autoMODE"` (case sensitive) that will search for all elements in the current _page_ with the page's button class (`.pageButton` by default). If you want to create the object without any buttons just provide an **empty Array** or a falsy value (`0`, `null`,  `undefined`, `false`, ...). If any of the specified ids does not exist, an error will be shown in console (but not thrown).
| Object | `callbacks` | Object specifying the callbacks associated to each _page_ `id`. The key must be equal to the `id` or an error will be thrown. The value must be a function and will receive the event object as an unique argument when called.
| Boolean | `callbacksEnabled` | `true` if you want to use the callbacks feature. `false` by default.
| String | `masterProperty` | CSS property whose transition end indicates when to call the callbacks, if enabled. `opacity` by default. The property specified is not validated for now.




###AUXILIAR (_PRIVATE_)

#####_normalizeIDs
`SwapperInstance._normalizeIDs(IDs, className)`

Returns the `IDs` parameter normalized as an Array of Strings (or an empty Array).

|         Type         |         Argument         | Description |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Array | `IDs` | Array of Strings that should be normalized. It can be a single String if there is only one ID. In that last case, there is a special value `"autoMODE"` (case sensitive) that will search for all elements in the current page with the `className` class and collect their ids. An empty Array or a falsy value (`0`, `null`,  `undefined`, `false`, ...) will return an empty array. Other values will throw an error.
| String | `className` | Class name to search elements whose ids to collect if `autoMODE` enabled.

TO-DO
-----
 - [ ] **Preload content**: Add methods (or create a derivated class) to add the functionality to preload content using AJAX or iframes **before** the user requests it.
 - [ ] **Paginate and cache content**: Add methods to _cache_ content that has already been requested by the user or preload (and _cache_) content that we think that will be requested later and manage it (set limits, decide which content to replace using LRU algorithm...).
 - [ ] **Navigation**: Implement the methods needed to enable history and back/forward-button functionality.
